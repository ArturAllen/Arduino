This project was created for the Arduino Uno and the multipurpose shield. It does not make use of the Arduino library, instead it focuses on register programming, aiming for improved performance and small size of the binary file.

The program has four possible modes:

1. The four LEDs on the shield blink top down in a cyclic manner
2. The four LEDs on the shield blink bottom up in a cyclic manner
3. The four LEDs on the shield blink at the same time
4. All LEDs on the shield are turned off

The shield has three buttons A1, A2, and A3. Pushing A1 triggers mode 1, pushing A2 triggers mode 2, pushing A3 triggers mode 3 and holding A3 for two seconds triggers mode 4.
